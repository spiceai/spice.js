# spice-js

This is an early version of a NodeJS SDK for Spice. The repository is meant to provide an easy library to pull data from the Apache Arrow Flight API (flight.spiceai.io)

## Dependencies

This project only needs NodeJS (v16+) and its package manager `npm` or `yarn`.

## Installation

Install all required library with `yarn install`

## Usage

The project is in progress, we can test the script too pull data with `yarn test` or build and run with `yarn build` then `yarn run run`.

## Development

Building then running has the advantage of giving a better stack trace in case or errors.
